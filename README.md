# Battleship

Description coming soon.

Initial issues:

- Some code can be rewritten to reduce redundant calls

- Even though heavily based on console 'graphics', several printing errors are present (strange how they went under the radar 3 years ago)

- Some messy code, including 'debugging printf's'

To do:

- Determine if scoring is actually necessary in this otherwise predetermined game.

- Include graphical representations in the help screen - what markers look like and when.

Further ideas:

- Support for multiple save files.

- Upgrade to socket communication and play the game on multiple machines.
