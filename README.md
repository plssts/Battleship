# Battleship

Description coming soon.

To do:

- Determine if scoring is actually necessary in this otherwise predetermined game.

- Include graphical representations in the help screen - what markers look like and when.

- Visually improve mode selection screen.

- Replace brutal 'button flash' prints with function calls.

- Replace 'expanding dialog' prints with function calls.

- Fix some printing issues.

- Inconsistencies: some calls use int**'s, some use structs.

Further ideas:

- Support for multiple save files.

- Upgrade to socket communication to play the game on multiple machines.
