# Battleship

Description coming soon.

Initial issues:

- Some code can be rewritten to reduce redundant calls

- Even though heavily based on console 'graphics', several printing errors are present (strange how they went under the radar 3 years ago)

- Some messy code, including 'debugging printf's'

To do:

- In 2 player mode, add some time before the 2nd player places their last ship and 1st player makes their shot.

Further ideas:

- Upgrade to socket communication and play the game on multiple machines.
